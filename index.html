								The moments when I most strongly connected with my writing were during what I call my moments of "writing trance". This state
								required certain external conditions. Picture this:
								</p>

								<p>
								I'm a night owl, my creative state activates around 22:00 and peaks around 3:00.
							
								I cleaned up my room and replaced all the candles with new ones. A steaming thermos full of tea is within reach. Four
								different lamps, one of which gives pink light, provide a gentle glow, creating the perfect atmosphere for me to embrace
								the quiet of the night. While everyone else sleeps, my mind is clear and as ready as it can be.
								</p>
								<p>
								My workspace almost resembles a gamer's setup. My laptop screen is linked to a larger monitor on a pile of magazines. On
								my screen, I organize the many tabs open to ensure everything is just ‘one shortcut’ away. Three tabs ‘control - right
								arrow’ and I'm at my ‘music station’ tab. The most important external element of my writing trance. I listen to either
								full sets on YouTube or various Playlists. The tempo of the music decides my writing tempo and creates a trance-like
								focus. It becomes a doorway to the memories I hold of raving which fuels me with inspiration. —A crazy drop in a trance
								song comes by and I smile. Sometimes, I can't help but dance a bit while sitting.
								My heart makes jumps of adrenaline as I keep typing. I ‘short-cut’ my way through my tabs and i become one with the loop
								of sounds. The loop of writing is happening between feelings, my memories, my sources, and the words I see appearing on
								the screen of my laptop. I shape the sentences like a sculptor shapes his work.
								</p>
								<p>
									<br>
								It really was the music that created immense joy within me while writing. And for that I do feel the need to THANK some
								of the tracks that guided me through the nights, creating my perfect ‘writing trance’. Feel free to listen to some of
								them while reading.
								</p>
								<br>
								Love,<br>

<h2 id="abstract">ABSTRACT</h2>

<p>In this artistic, sometimes speculative, research document, I will delve into an exploration of three different
manifestations of energy&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;that get released
at rave parties. These manifestations contain; the light as part of designated scenography, the powerful sonic of
electronic music, and the kinetic energy of the dancing crowd. I aim to understand how these external influences
fuel my internal energy. By examining the motivation behind my creative processes,<br> I aim to explore how to transform
this evoked energy into creative drive. By gaining awareness about this, could this be used as a tool?</p>
<p>I will reflect on my past experiences at raves while mindfully engaging with a new one. During this, I will heighten
my awareness and engage all my senses in the experience. I will attentively reflect on, for instance, a
philosophical text on light or the neurological explanation of how rhythm is connected to emotion. I made notes
while raving, on which I later reflected by the act of writing. This approach allowed me to use raving as a research
method. The necessity of mid-process, attending a rave to conclude my statements inherently answers an important
aspect of what I suppose.</p>
<p>In this document, I explore my main topics from the standpoint of three artistic sources: a piece of writing by
philosopher Hans Blumenberg, a music-related video of a performance by Jeff Mills, and I will introduce a video
artwork by Rineke Dijkstra. Analyzing these external and creative sources helped me refine my perspective on the
topics of my text. It also made me conclude how some elements of energy are integrated into my creative processes as
a photographer and graphic designer.</p>

<h2 id="preperation">PREPARATION</h2>

<p>This piece of writing is constructed into three chapters: <br>
<i>—Sight, Sound, and Space.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I was inspired by the titles of the three-fold compilation album of tracks by
Jeff Mills (released in 2019). Each album contains around 14 tracks, curated to embody Mills’s interpretation of the
three words: Sight, Sound, and Space. In my text, I will embody my own interpretation of these words to take you
along the experience of Rave.
</p><br>
<p>Raves&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-2" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;have existed since the 1980s, and
techno and trance music have massively grown in popularity worldwide in recent years. Social media and marketing
allowed the scene to explode. Consequently, the genre attracted more people and it became part of the mainstream. In
this scene, I often experience a high level of compatibility. However, in my view, music isn't about superiority or
outdoing each other. It is about immersing yourself in it and forming connections by sharing your passion for it
with others. Which is exactly what I intend to do with this document. I aim to write this text not as an academic
explanative text on this universally recognized and admired phenomenon. I believe we can gain a different kind of
knowledge by intuitively exploring the depths of a subject and by opening up to learn from artistic resources.
Speculation and imagination, along with external evidence, can bring insightful results in the thesis-world full of
academic constraints.</p>
<p>I've deepened my understanding of these external factors of energy not only by reading about them but also by
actively absorbing and listening (to) them. But what surprised me the most is how much I've learned through writing
about these subjects. I see writing as an opportunity to delve into the depths of my psyche and I used it to explore
how to integrate the energy I receive at raves into my everyday life. I see writing as a form of enhancing awareness
and appreciation. By transforming thoughts into written words, experimenting with linguistic choices, and crafting
sentences until they resonate with truth, writing itself becomes a research method.</p>

	<li id="fn-2" value="2">Rave is an umbrella term that covers a music and dance subculture. It’s characterized by the
		technological, conceptual, and social construction of a sensorial experience that offers the possibility of finding
		freedom in unity by sharing music engagement through the act of dancing. The term ‘Rave’ holds a certain stigma in
		my generation. However, the fact that it means: to do something with 'extravagant enthusiasm’ completely aligns with
		the message and the style in which I aspire to write.</li>

			<h2 id="chapter-1">01. SIGHT </h2>

	<p>Through contemplated scenography the spaces where raves occur temporarily transform into utopian places. We travel to
		unknown destinations, <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> away from home and normal life.
		We enter a new landscape. One in which all noses literally and figuratively point in the same direction. Whether the
		rave takes place in a small bunker-like room, a high-ceilinged old factory, or in the middle of a forest, these
		spaces take on new shapes when they morph into a large mass of dancing bodies. The residual space fills itself with
		haze or smoke which alters the physical environment. It enhances the feeling of being part of a distorted reality.
		This manipulation of the sense of knowing where you are is a gateway to a different state of being. One in which
		your everyday thoughts make place for a sensorial experience where seeing, listening, and feeling are paramount.
		Most central to the scenography is light. It serves not just as an illuminator, but also as the director of the
		experience, guiding the participant's gaze and emotions. The use of light shapes a dramatic structure. When it comes
		to raves, light is more than just a tool—it's an integral part of the experience.</p>
	
	<p>Light reveals surfaces and faces. It touches the outer 'shell' of the silhouettes of dancing bodies and colorizes the
		often radical architectural environments into places of wonder. Light was also a central element in famous
		architect; Louis Kahn's philosophy because he regarded it as a <i>“giver of all presences.”</i><br><blockquote>Louis Kahn
		said: <i>“Even a space intended to be dark should have just enough light from some mysterious opening to tell us
			how dark it really is.”</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-4" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> &nbsp;</blockquote>
			I
		enjoy reading about the concept of light from the perspective of various disciplines. By incorporating elements from
		these sources into the context of the chapter ‘Sight’ I can awaken the memories I have regarding certain scenography
		that I have encountered in the past. That happened for instance when I stumped upon this text by philosopher Hans
		Blumenberg:</p>
	
	<p>
		<blockquote>
		<i>Light can be a directed beam, a guiding beacon in the dark, an advancing dethronement of darkness, but also a
			dazzling super-abundance, as well as an indefinite, omnipresent brightness containing all: the ‘letting-appear’
			that does not itself appear, the inaccessible accessibility of things. Light and darkness can represent the
			absolute metaphysical counterforces that exclude each other and yet bring the world constellation into
			existence. Or, light is the absolute power of being, which reveals the paltriness of the dark, which can no
			longer exist once light has come to existence. Light is intrusive; in its abundance, it creates the
			overwhelming, conspicuous clarity with which the true ‘comes forth’; it forcibly acquires the irrevocability of
			Spirit’s consent. Light remains what it is while letting the infinite participate in it; it is consumption
			without loss. Light produces space, distance, orientation, calm contemplation; it is the gift that makes no
			demands, the illumination capable of conquering without force.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-5"
					href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></i></blockquote>
	</p>
	
	<p>I see parallels between his text and my attempt to describe the influence of light at raves. In these spaces, light
		is not just seen—it's experienced. “Light produces space, distance, orientation, and calm contemplation”. Taking
		from this, it means that by mindfully designing the synergetic landscapes of clubs and festivals the designers get
		the chance to play with all of these values. By manipulating them our position towards these values changes. It's
		the ‘invisible hand’ that influences perception. Light designers and scenographers program lights to coincide with,
		or intentionally diverge, from the music's rhythms, allowing the eyes to take part in the experience. It’s a way to
		let our ‘Sight’ enjoy the composition of the infinite loop of changing rhythms as well.</p>
	
	<p>Though not as literal as in the creation of light installations, light has been the most integral part of my creative
		processes since I started creating. Light, in its many forms and manifestations, acts as a source of profound
		inspiration for me. It does so by quite literally illuminating the world that surrounds me, acting as a stimulant
		that sparks my urgent instinct to capture everything that strikes my eye. The process of creation is a powerful
		medium through which I can unveil my visual perception of the world to others. It’s a bridge connecting my inner
		perspectives to the outer realities. This could be the reason why I hold photography as my most significant form of
		creative expression. Photography allows me to immortalize the images I see around me created by light. The geometric
		boundaries of the shape of a photograph serve as borders in which with carefully chosen limits, I have the power to
		orchestrate the elements of composition, form, color, and texture, shaping the image according to my vision.</p>

				<h2 id="chapter-2">02. SOUND </h2>
		<p>In the chapter 'Sound' I will further convey the connection I have with the energy-driven. As well in the visual as
			the sonic field. Electronic music, in the most literal sense, is made with electronic devices using electricity.
			When its energy is being released it has the ability to transfer it to me. I'm often told that I have an energetic
			character, and I believe that the energy-driven fuels that part of me.</p>
		
		<p>The documentary 'Sisters with Transistors’ &nbsp;<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-6" href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>
			&nbsp;highlights female pioneers in the history of electronic music. The film portrays the early days when the art
			of sequencing and tape recording electronic noises from synthesizers started to carefully be accepted as making
			music. For some people ‘computer music’ was the utter dehumanization of music. For these women, <sup
				class="footnote"><a id="fnref-7" href="#fn-7">7</a></sup> &nbsp;it was the liberation of it. Their role as
			pioneers in the then predominantly white, male field of composers makes them the true revolutionary heroes in the
			rise of electronic music. Watching this compelling documentary made me think a lot about how composing electronic
			music is quite similar to the visuality of graphic design. It deals with rigid content and it’s about composing in
			an often repetitive structure. The art of it lies in handling its many details with great precision and accuracy.
			And when the organic exists, it will always be cored in the punctuality of a computer. Looking at it in this way,
			you could say electronic music is the ‘graphic design’ within music genres.</p>
		
		<p>The main appealing element in Electronic Music &nbsp;<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-8" href="#fn-8">8</a></sup>
			&nbsp;for me is the building of tension created by repetitive rhythmic loops that join the musical anatomy one after
			the other. This element of repetition has a calming effect on my nervous system. I think it's because these
			recurring loops play into my quick memory and cognitive sharpness. It’s like I become part of the rhythm. Not a
			necessity, but sometimes, more often in Trance, small vocal lines take part in the synergistic groups of sound. My
			favorite type of vocals lean towards the ethereal sound of singing holistic angels. It enhances the spirit of the
			“altered state of consciousness”, a term often used when talking about a state of trance or hypnosis. Which differs
			not so much from holistic experiences.</p>
		
		<p>My absolute favorite type of sound is the sound of Acid. Acid refers to an electronic squelch sound produced by the
			Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. This sound is typically achieved by increasing the filter echo and
			lowering the synthesizer's frequency. It’s a dirty sound. A dissonant sound that feels highly electronic. There’s no
			acoustic instrument that could produce this kind of sound. I could best describe the sound as if it scratching your
			brain from the inside. Or as I discussed once with my friend while dancing: it penetrates your ears.</p>
		
		<p>The strict frequencies of repetition work hypnotically and raise the feeling of immense joy within me. As if I’m in
			love.
			
			<blockquote>
			<i>“The close link between rhythm and emotions is illustrated by the central role of prediction and
				anticipation. By its very nature, rhythmic entrainment generates expectations, explicitly or implicitly, and it
				is known that dopamine release is indeed related to musical expectations … Rhythmic entrainment is also based on
				temporal expectancies in time and is, therefore, a specific kind of musical expectancy.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</i> <sup
				class="footnote"><a id="fnref-9" href="#fn-9">9</a></sup></blockquote>
				
				Through the music and the often, external repetitive rhythms the sound interacts with the internal body rhythm of the listener such as the heart rate. When
			the rhythm adjusts and eventually synchronizes to a common frequency it then triggers an emotional response much in
			the same way that amusement could trigger smiling. Talking about laughter; often when I'm deeply immersed in the act
			of listening, particularly after building up towards the powerful drops, I experience this unique sensation that
			compels me to laugh. It's a feeling that bubbles up from within, a reaction to the overwhelming mix of emotions.
			Another facial expression I often make when the music is just really good is the face you make when smelling
			something dirty. The facial expressions act as a non-verbal way of letting others know that the track you hear is
			doing it for you. I recently devoted the name of a shared playlist with a friend to it; “Vies kijken”. We decided to
			curate the list to only electronic music that makes us pull the face of ‘dirt’. It’s a dirty good list if you ask
			me.</p>
		
		<p>To further illustrate my analysis of the construction of Electronic music, I'll reference a performance from 2005 by
			Jeff Mills with the Montpelier Philharmonic Orchestra. <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-10"
					href="#fn-10">10</a></sup> &nbsp;Under the guidance of a conductor, the orchestra along with Mills on his
			beloved Roland TR-909 drum machine, performs songs by Mills. Included in their repertoire is the well-known song
			"The Bells" from the album "Sight, Sound, and Space”. When later mindfully ‘studying’ (listening) to this track on
			Spotify my eye fell for the title in the artwork which gave me the inspiration for the titles of the chapters in
			this text. To explain my analysis: the way Mills creates live electronic music with his drum machine is the same as
			how the orchestra functions. Through the guidance of the conductor, the different groups of musicians (playing
			different instruments), know when to enter the anatomy of the music one by one. Next to that they are also guided by
			the conductor’s hand gestures on how to play in terms of emotion and intensity. In a way, Jeff Mills, at that moment
			is the conductor of the stored electronic sounds that are in the drum machine in front of him. Jeff Mills is the
			conductor of the sounds and guides them into when, and with what emotion the stored energy is being released.</p></div>

			<h2 id="chapter-3">03. SPACE </h2>

			<p>
				I interpret the meaning of the word 'Space' as one of being in a state of
				space within the body and
				mind. My ‘space’ is one of unstoppable energy. With the energy I gained from
				‘Sight’ and ‘Sound’ I
				can step in and contribute to the interplay between the different
				manifestations. This interplay
				creates Momentum within me.
			</p>

			<p>
			<p>
			<blockquote>
				<span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Momentum:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
			
				
				<i>“If a process or movement gains momentum, it keeps developing or happening
					more quickly
					and keeps becoming less likely to stop."
				</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-11" href="#fn-11">11</a></sup>
			</blockquote>
			</p>f

			<p>
				Much like solar panels store sunlight, I've found that I can store momentum
				until long after the rave has concluded. It
				operates by releasing dopamine, which I can use in my creative processes.
				These processes can be image or
				graphic-related projects, but also the creativity needed for writing this
				text relied a lot on the amount of momentum
				within me. This storage can run empty I’ve discovered. I have tried to fuel
				it with things like attending the light
				exhibition ‘Radiant Voids’ curated by Lumus Instruments. Or by gathering
				with 3 friends for an ‘Electronic music night’
				in which we drank beers and exchanged our current favorite tracks until the
				early hours of the morning. But to enter my
				‘Space’ both ‘Sight’ and ‘Sound’ have to be united. My last rave was around
				2 months ago and for the writing of this
				last chapter, I felt it was necessary to enter the physical space of a rave
				and open up to my ‘state of space’ in the
				most attentive way I ever did. And so that’s exactly what I did.
			</p>

			<p>
				The tickets of the night that I was planning on attempting were sold old but
				I turned my ticket swap notifications on
				and took part in the ticket battle with fellow hungry ravers. The moment I
				got a grip on a ticket it felt like I won a
				prize. And so, my night of research could begin.
				The line to enter the club was long and force full sounding electronic music
				slipped out of the club through the
				entrance. The first form of energy is already heard in line, and like the
				emergence of a crescendo, it created tension
				within me. After entering and finding lockers to free ourselves from our
				everyday possessions, my two friends and I went
				on a little explorative trip throughout the club. A place where I have been
				multiple times. But tonight will officially
				be the last as this is the closing party of the club. The rave is spread
				throughout 3 areas. Attending a multi-area club
				offers the thrill of experiencing different adventures in one night,
				Entering various landscapes where different
				languages are spoken with varying tempos and intensities.

				our everyday possessions, my two
				friends and I went on a little explorative trip throughout the club. A place
				where I have been multiple times. But
				tonight will officially be the last as this is the closing party of the
				club. The rave is spread throughout 3 areas.
				Attending a multi-area club offers the thrill of experiencing different
				adventures in one night, Entering various
				landscapes where different languages are spoken with varying tempos and
				intensities.
			</p>

			<p>
				I consciously absorb everything around me. I document the thoughts that
				strike me on the Notes app on my phone.
				Never before have I ‘looked’ and ‘listened’ this attentively. It’s like I
				said before, an opportunity to actively
				appreciate something that I enjoy doing so much. It’s interesting how it
				feels like getting to know myself better.
				Normally when attending a rave I’m quite aware of the timetable and the DJs
				who are playing. Due to my last-minute
				decision to attend this rave, I’m not at all this night. I believe this is
				beneficial for my research. It allows for
				unpredictability and frees me from the need to change locations whenever the
				DJs switch time slots. I'm open and
				prepared for any experience that comes my way.
			</p>

			<p>
				Above the first area, a light installation is installed In which three
				rectangles intersect each other. In these
				rectangles, the light moves through the geometric lanes. Little dots of
				light follow the lines of the premeditated
				structure like they’re chasing one another. Whenever the other lights in the
				room dim, leaving only the rectangles
				visible, the tiny dots of light remind me of stars. However, unlike the
				random placement of stars in the night sky,
				these "stars" follow a path designated by the light designer. This is the
				visual energy that was stored in
				preparation for the event and now, finally has been released to assist me in
				my journey to ‘Space’. The speed of the
				running stars adapts to the changing pace of the music. They support me in
				the act of surrendering myself to the
				trance-inducing rhythms within my sight and the sound.
			</p>

			<p>
				Often the title of a track or a small line of text with a powerful message
				is used as additional vocal power to add
				energy to a track. While dancing, I noticed the repetition of these small
				sections of text function similarly to a
				mantra. Initially, the mantra is repeated until I fully embody its message.
				I envision the vocals leading a slowly
				advancing, almost demonstrative march of communication. Then, to increase
				persuasion, new electronic sounds join the
				march one by one in the order of the often 4/4 beat.
			</p>

			<p>
				Raves alter our perception of time, reshaping it around the duration of the
				experience. Raves can last for hours or
				even days, temporarily altering our perception of time once we're immersed
				in 'Space'. The timeframe of the night is
				segmented with various stories being narrated. I wrote in my notes while
				dancing: “Some choose to write poems others
				write novels”. Some DJs tell their stories by highlighting the chores in
				different tracks. Others let their story be
				one constructive journey that stretches out over the entire duration of
				their set wherein the changing of tracks is
				almost unremarkable. Apart from the fact that DJs come prepared in terms of
				what narrative they plan on telling by
				layering and structuring, there still is a lot of space for interaction with
				the dancing crowd in terms of the
				overall flow. This interaction leads to an additional story unfolding,
				transforming the narrative into one that
				includes everyone.
			</p>

			<p>
				I enter my ’Space’. I adapt the movements I make with my body to whatever
				tension the track is building up. My feet
				follow the consistent underlying four-beat bass drum of the track. My left
				and right foot alternate. I start with
				small movements and to change up the dance I sometimes decide to stay one
				count longer left or right. It’s the
				little changes in the movements that make the dance interesting. My brain
				constantly plays the game of adapting my
				movements to the changes in the music. Due to my musically trained mind and
				feel for rhythm I can play a game of
				prediction. By listening and learning from the repetitive loops I get a grip
				on the structure which creates the
				ability to change my movements at the exact moment the music changes.
				Whenever my prediction is right I get
				overwhelmed with energy that I use in performing whatever next track that is
				going to challenge me.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that my legs visualize the consistent rhythm of the track my arms are
				here to demonstrate the other additional
				sounds that joined the sonic landscape of the track. Obsessed with
				visualizing what I hear I use my hands like a
				conductor. Some moments my left and right hand mirror each other. Other
				times they alternate to take the opportunity
				of visualizing even more elements in the music. I start small and I follow
				the tension of the track going bigger and
				bigger. Just like a conductor would do. It reminds me of the video I
				introduced earlier. Here the conductor directed
				the Montpellier Orchestra and Jeff Mills. In the situation of my ‘Space’ the
				same thing happens to me but then the
				other way around. The music acts as the conductor of which movements I make
				and with what conviction I carry them
				out. When the energy of the music rises to a point beyond exact expression,
				all that's left to do is jump and throw
				my arms

			<p>
				To elaborate on the impact of music as a tool to unfold normally hidden
				facets of people’s persona, I'm including a
				video artwork from 2009 by Rineke Dijkstra called,<i> ‘The Krazyhouse’.</i> &nbsp;
				<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-12" href="#fn-12">12</a></sup> &nbsp;The
				artwork contains 5 videos of teenagers,
				named Megan, Simon, Nicky, Philip, and Dee. In the video, the teenagers
				dance in front of a white backdrop to a
				selected music track. Dijkstra met the performers in ‘The Krazyhouse
				nightclub’ in Liverpool and asked them to come
				to a studio she constructed in the club during the daytime and dance to
				their favorite song. The neutral white
				background draws attention to the teenagers and how they present themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dijkstra has described the filmed clips as ‘portraits’, explaining that she
				wanted to see if she could make a
				portrait of somebody that reveals parts of themselves just by dancing. At
				times, the teenagers performing seem
				self-conscious, adjusting their clothing and looking shy at the still
				camera. Further in the video, they confidently
				perform varied dance moves as the result of their very personal musical
				engagement.
			</p>
			<p>
				By individualizing an experience that is usually lived collectively, the
				work raises questions about authenticity
				and the boundary between the personal and the general. What I interpret from
				this artwork is how much people can
				communicate through their body movements. The artwork is a representation of
				the immediate influence of music on
				dance as a general phenomenon. In some videos, you can see teenagers
				struggling at first. However, once they
				surrender to the music, they enter their 'Space'. Analyzing the video
				artwork led me to question whether these five
				individuals are aware of their 'momentum'. If they know how to recharge, and
				if entering their 'space' is their
				method for doing so.
			</p>
			<p>
				My inner energy is being activated. It’s my fuel to stay on the dance hour
				after hour. It’s so addictive that I
				continue dancing even when my legs start to cramp and my mouth starts to
				become dry. The people who know me well,
				know that I dance until the drops of sweat are running all across my body. I
				pull my fully wet hair up in a bun and
				continue my everlasting self-created choreography. I give everything I have.
				People smile at me and some even come
				towards me to bring me a high five. Even though I dance purely for myself, I
				do find joy in receiving recognition
				for the physical effort that dancing requires. I love the moments of
				interaction with strangers and the exchange of
				energy whenever they join me and take part in the movements I perform. No
				words are used but there is so much
				communication possible in the non-verbal way that dancing together offers.
				There have been a few times that fellow
				ravers came up to me to thank me for the energy I carried out. I can tell
				you without hesitation that those moments
				in ‘Space’ were some of the best moments in my life.

				<h2 id="intergration">INTEGRATION</h2>

				<p>We raved the night away. The brightness of the new day pulls me back to
					reality as I make my way home. I like this
					moment. It's a moment for reflection in the early hours on the quiet
					morning streets.
					My physical body is tired and sore but I can feel it again: the momentum
					runs through every vein. The remaining
					question is how and when to integrate this newly gained momentum. For
					now, I can only speculate:</p>

				<p>From Blumenberg, I learned how light is the absolute power of being.
					Superior in the field of sight. And I, as the
					observer of it all am at the same time the composer. I hold the creative
					power to decide when to stop time and
					immortalize the ever-changing form of light. Letting the graphical
					element created by light unfold and dictate when
					to freeze time and capture a moment.<br>
					Through his mastery of firm frequencies, Mills draws graphical
					inspiration with his sound. His ability to orchestrate
					rigid narratives resonates with me. His strict structures teach me how
					to handle detail and precision. The release
					of stored energetic sounds, composted to forceful rhythmic loops, demand
					me to follow, strike my core, and at the
					same time calm my mind.<br>
					Dijkstra confirmed all thoughts I had on music being the most powerful
					tool to let expressiveness exist. It’s a
					gateway to a form of self that normally doesn’t get the chance to exist.
					Through the act of dance ‘Space’ is made
					accessible. And through ‘Space’ one can build momentum. As we navigate
					momentum, we can direct its energy toward
					what needs it the most. This is the power of transferring gained energy
					into the one you can give.</p>
