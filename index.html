				<h1 id="abstract">ABSTRACT</h1>

				<p> In this artistic, sometimes speculative, research document, I will delve into an exploration of
					three different manifestations of energy <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1"
							href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> that get released at rave parties.
					These manifestations contain; the light as part of designated scenography, the powerful sonic of
					electronic music, and the kinetic energy of the dancing crowd. I aim to understand how these
					external influences fuel my internal energy. By examining the motivation behind my creative
					processes, I aim to explore how to transform this evoked energy into creative drive. By gaining
					awareness about this, could this be used as a tool?

				</p>

				<p> I will reflect on my past experiences at raves while mindfully engaging with a new one. During this,
					I will heighten my awareness and engage all my senses in the experience. I will attentively reflect
					on, for instance, a philosophical text on light or the neurological explanation of how rhythm is
					connected to emotion. I made notes while raving, on which I later reflected by the act of writing.
					This approach allowed me to use raving as a research method. The necessity of mid-process, attending
					a rave to conclude my statements inherently answers an important aspect of what I suppose.

				</p>
				<p> In this document, I explore my main topics from the standpoint of three artistic sources: a piece of
					writing by philosopher Hans Blumenberg, a music-related video of a performance by Jeff Mills, and I
					will introduce a video artwork by Rineke Dijkstra. Analyzing these external and creative sources
					helped me refine my perspective on the topics of my text. It also made me conclude how some elements
					of energy are integrated into my creative processes as a photographer and graphic designer.

				<h1 id="preperation">PREPERATION</h1>

				<p> This piece of writing is constructed into three chapters: <br>
					<h9>—Sight, Sound, and Space.</h9>
					I was inspired by the titles of the three-fold compilation album of tracks by Jeff Mills (released
					in 2019). Each album contains around 14 tracks, curated to embody Mills’s interpretation of the
					three words: Sight, Sound, and Space. In my text, I will embody my own interpretation of these words
					to take you along the experience of Rave.
				</p>
				<p> Raves <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-2" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> have existed since the 1980s,
					and techno and trance music have massively grown in popularity
					worldwide in recent years. Social media and marketing allowed the scene to explode. Consequently,
					the genre attracted more people and it became part of the mainstream. In this scene, I often
					experience a high level of compatibility. However, in my view, music isn't about superiority or
					outdoing each other. It is about immersing yourself in it and forming connections by sharing your
					passion for it with others. Which is exactly what I intend to do with this document. I aim to write
					this text not as an academic explanative text on this universally recognized and admired phenomenon.
					I believe we can gain a different kind of knowledge by intuitively exploring the depths of a subject
					and by opening up to learn from artistic resources. Speculation and imagination, along with external
					evidence, can bring insightful results in the thesis-world full of academic constraints.

				</p>
				<p> I've deepened my understanding of these external factors of energy not only by reading about them
					but also by actively absorbing and listening (to) them. But what surprised me the most is how much
					I've learned through writing about these subjects. I see writing as an opportunity to delve into the
					depths of my psyche and I used it to explore how to integrate the energy I receive at raves into my
					everyday life. I see writing as a form of enhancing awareness and appreciation. By transforming
					thoughts into written words, experimenting with linguistic choices, and crafting sentences until
					they resonate with truth, writing itself becomes a research method.

				<h2 id="chapter-1">01. SIGHT </h2>

				<p>Through contemplated scenography the spaces where raves occur temporarily transform into utopian
					places. We travel to unknown destinations, <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-3"
							href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> away from home and normal life. We enter a new landscape. One in
					which all noses literally and figuratively point in the same direction. Whether the rave takes place
					in a small bunker-like room, a high-ceilinged old factory, or in the middle of a forest, these
					spaces take on new shapes when they morph into a large mass of dancing bodies. The residual space
					fills itself with haze or smoke which alters the physical environment. It enhances the feeling of
					being part of a distorted reality. This manipulation of the sense of knowing where you are is a
					gateway to a different state of being. One in which your everyday thoughts make place for a
					sensorial experience where seeing, listening, and feeling are paramount. Most central to the
					scenography is light. It serves not just as an illuminator, but also as the director of the
					experience, guiding the participant's gaze and emotions. The use of light shapes a dramatic
					structure. When it comes to raves, light is more than just a tool—it's an integral part of the
					experience.
				</p>


				<p>Light reveals surfaces and faces. It touches the outer 'shell' of the silhouettes of dancing bodies
					and colorizes the
					often radical architectural environments into places of wonder. Light was also a central element in
					famous
					architect; Louis Kahn's philosophy because he regarded it as a <h9>“giver of all presences.”</h9><br>
					Louis Kahn said:
					<h9>“Even a space intended to be dark should have just enough light from some mysterious opening to
						tell us how dark
						it really is.”</h9> <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-4" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> I enjoy
					reading about the
					concept of light from the perspective of various disciplines. By incorporating elements from these
					sources into the
					context of the chapter ‘Sight’ I can awaken the memories I have regarding certain scenography that I
					have
					encountered in the past. That happened for instance when I stumped upon this text by philosopher
					Hans Blumenberg:
				</p>


				<p>
					<h9>Light can be a directed beam, a guiding beacon in the dark, an advancing dethronement of
						darkness, but also a
						dazzling super-abundance, as well as an indefinite, omnipresent brightness containing all: the
						‘letting-appear’
						that does not itself appear, the inaccessible accessibility of things. Light and darkness can
						represent the
						absolute metaphysical counterforces that exclude each other and yet bring the world
						constellation into
						existence. Or, light is the absolute power of being, which reveals the paltriness of the dark,
						which can no
						longer exist once light has come to existence. Light is intrusive; in its abundance, it creates
						the
						overwhelming, conspicuous clarity with which the true ‘comes forth’; it forcibly acquires the
						irrevocability of
						Spirit’s consent. Light remains what it is while letting the infinite participate in it; it is
						consumption
						without loss. Light produces space, distance, orientation, calm contemplation; it is the gift
						that makes no
						demands, the illumination capable of conquering without force.<sup class="footnote"><a
								id="fnref-5" href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></h9>
				</p>


				<p>I see parallels between his text and my attempt to describe the influence of light at raves. In these
					spaces, light
					is not just seen—it's experienced. “Light produces space, distance, orientation, and calm
					contemplation”. Taking
					from this, it means that by mindfully designing the synergetic landscapes of clubs and festivals the
					designers get
					the chance to play with all of these values. By manipulating them our position towards these values
					changes. It's
					the ‘invisible hand’ that influences perception. Light designers and scenographers program lights to
					coincide with,
					or intentionally diverge, from the music's rhythms, allowing the eyes to take part in the
					experience. It’s a way to
					let our ‘Sight’ enjoy the composition of the infinite loop of changing rhythms as well.
				</p>


				<p>
					Though not as literal as in the creation of light installations, light has been the most integral
					part of my creative
					processes since I started creating. Light, in its many forms and manifestations, acts as a source of
					profound
					inspiration for me. It does so by quite literally illuminating the world that surrounds me, acting
					as a stimulant
					that sparks my urgent instinct to capture everything that strikes my eye. The process of creation is
					a powerful
					medium through which I can unveil my visual perception of the world to others. It’s a bridge
					connecting my inner
					perspectives to the outer realities. This could be the reason why I hold photography as my most
					significant form of
					creative expression. Photography allows me to immortalize the images I see around me created by
					light. The geometric
					boundaries of the shape of a photograph serve as borders in which with carefully chosen limits, I
					have the power to
					orchestrate the elements of composition, form, color, and texture, shaping the image according to my
					vision.

				<h2 id="chapter-2">02. SOUND </h2>
				<p>
					In the chapter 'Sound' I will further convey the connection I have with the energy-driven. As well
					in the visual as
					the sonic field. Electronic music, in the most literal sense, is made with electronic devices using
					electricity.
					When its energy is being released it has the ability to transfer it to me. I'm often told that I
					have an energetic
					character, and I believe that the energy-driven fuels that part of me.
				</p>

				<p>
					The documentary 'Sisters with Transistors’ <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-6"
							href="#fn-6">6</a></sup> highlights
					female pioneers in the history of electronic music. The film portrays the early days when the art of
					sequencing and
					tape recording electronic noises from synthesizers started to carefully be accepted as making music.
					For some people
					‘computer music’ was the utter dehumanization of music. For these women, <sup class="footnote"><a
							id="fnref-7" href="#fn-7">7</a></sup> it was the liberation of it. Their role as pioneers in
					the then predominantly
					white, male field of composers makes them the true revolutionary heroes in the rise of electronic
					music. Watching
					this compelling documentary made me think a lot about how composing electronic music is quite
					similar to the
					visuality of graphic design. It deals with rigid content and it’s about composing in an often
					repetitive structure.
					The art of it lies in handling its many details with great precision and accuracy. And when the
					organic exists, it
					will always be cored in the punctuality of a computer. Looking at it in this way, you could say
					electronic music is
					the ‘graphic design’ within music genres.
				</p>

				<p>
					The main appealing element in Electronic Music <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-8"
							href="#fn-8">8</a></sup> for me
					is the building of tension created by repetitive rhythmic loops that join the musical anatomy one after
					the other. This
					element of repetition has a calming effect on my nervous system. I think it's because these
					recurring loops play
					into my quick memory and cognitive sharpness. It’s like I become part of the rhythm. Not a
					necessity, but sometimes,
					more often in Trance, small vocal lines take part in the synergistic groups of sound. My favorite
					type of vocals
					lean towards the ethereal sound of singing holistic angels. It enhances the spirit of the “altered
					state of
					consciousness”, a term often used when talking about a state of trance or hypnosis. Which differs
					not so much from
					holistic experiences.
				</p>

				<p>
					My absolute favorite type of sound is the sound of Acid. Acid refers to an electronic squelch sound
					produced by the
					Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. This sound is typically achieved by increasing the
					filter echo and
					lowering the synthesizer's frequency. It’s a dirty sound. A dissonant sound that feels highly
					electronic. There’s no
					acoustic instrument that could produce this kind of sound. I could best describe the sound as if it
					scratching your
					brain from the inside. Or as I discussed once with my friend while dancing: it penetrates your ears.
				</p>

				<p>
					The strict frequencies of repetition work hypnotically and raise the feeling of immense joy within
					me. As if I’m in
					love.
					<h9>“The close link between rhythm and emotions is illustrated by the central role of prediction and
						anticipation.
						By its very nature, rhythmic entrainment generates expectations, explicitly or implicitly, and
						it is known that
						dopamine release is indeed related to musical expectations … Rhythmic entrainment is also based
						on temporal
						expectancies in time and is, therefore, a specific kind of musical expectancy.”</h9> <sup
						class="footnote"><a id="fnref-9" href="#fn-9">9</a></sup><br>
					Through the music and the often, external repetitive rhythms the sound interacts with the internal
					body rhythm of
					the listener such as the heart rate. When the rhythm adjusts and eventually synchronizes to a common
					frequency it
					then triggers an emotional response much in the same way that amusement could trigger smiling.
					Talking about laughter; often when I'm deeply immersed in the act of listening, particularly after
					building up
					towards the powerful drops, I experience this unique sensation that compels me to laugh. It's a
					feeling that bubbles
					up from within, a reaction to the overwhelming mix of emotions. Another facial expression I often
					make when the
					music is just really good is the face you make when smelling something dirty. The facial expressions
					act as a
					non-verbal way of letting others know that the track you hear is doing it for you. I recently
					devoted the name of a
					shared playlist with a friend to it; “Vies kijken”. We decided to curate the list to only electronic
					music that
					makes us pull the face of ‘dirt’. It’s a dirty good list if you ask me.
				</p>

				<p>
					To further illustrate my analysis of the construction of Electronic music, I'll reference a
					performance from 2005 by
					Jeff Mills with the Montpelier Philharmonic Orchestra.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-10"
							href="#fn-10">10</a></sup> Under the guidance of a conductor, the orchestra along with
					Mills on his beloved Roland TR-909 drum machine, performs songs by Mills. Included in their
					repertoire is the
					well-known song "The Bells" from the album "Sight, Sound, and Space”. When later mindfully
					‘studying’ (listening) to
					this track on Spotify my eye fell for the title in the artwork which gave me the inspiration for the
					titles of the
					chapters in this text. To explain my analysis: the way Mills creates live electronic music with his
					drum machine is
					the same as how the orchestra functions. Through the guidance of the conductor, the different groups
					of musicians
					(playing different instruments), know when to enter the anatomy of the music one by one. Next to
					that they are also
					guided by the conductor’s hand gestures on how to play in terms of emotion and intensity. In a way,
					Jeff Mills, at
					that moment is the conductor of the stored electronic sounds that are in the drum machine in front
					of him. Jeff
					Mills is the conductor of the sounds and guides them into when, and with what emotion the stored
					energy is being
					released.

				<h2 id="chapter-3">03. SPACE </h2>

				<p>
					I interpret the meaning of the word 'Space' as one of being in a state of space within the body and
					mind. My ‘space’ is one of unstoppable energy. With the energy I gained from ‘Sight’ and ‘Sound’ I
					can step in and contribute to the interplay between the different manifestations. This interplay
					creates Momentum within me.
				</p>

				<p>
					<p><h9>Momentum:</p></h9>
					<h9>“If a process or movement gains momentum, it keeps developing or happening more quickly
					and keeps becoming less likely to stop."
					</h9> <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-11" href="#fn-11">11</a></sup>
				</p>

				<p>
					Much like solar panels store sunlight, I've found that I can store momentum until long after the rave has concluded. It
					operates by releasing dopamine, which I can use in my creative processes. These processes can be image or
					graphic-related projects, but also the creativity needed for writing this text relied a lot on the amount of momentum
					within me. This storage can run empty I’ve discovered. I have tried to fuel it with things like attending the light
					exhibition ‘Radiant Voids’ curated by Lumus Instruments. Or by gathering with 3 friends for an ‘Electronic music night’
					in which we drank beers and exchanged our current favorite tracks until the early hours of the morning. But to enter my
					‘Space’ both ‘Sight’ and ‘Sound’ have to be united. My last rave was around 2 months ago and for the writing of this
					last chapter, I felt it was necessary to enter the physical space of a rave and open up to my ‘state of space’ in the
					most attentive way I ever did. And so that’s exactly what I did.
				</p>

				<p>
					The tickets of the night that I was planning on attempting were sold old but I turned my ticket swap notifications on
					and took part in the ticket battle with fellow hungry ravers. The moment I got a grip on a ticket it felt like I won a
					prize. And so, my night of research could begin.
					The line to enter the club was long and force full sounding electronic music slipped out of the club through the
					entrance. The first form of energy is already heard in line, and like the emergence of a crescendo, it created tension
					within me. After entering and finding lockers to free ourselves from our everyday possessions, my two friends and I went
					on a little explorative trip throughout the club. A place where I have been multiple times. But tonight will officially
					be the last as this is the closing party of the club. The rave is spread throughout 3 areas. Attending a multi-area club
					offers the thrill of experiencing different adventures in one night, Entering various landscapes where different
					languages are spoken with varying tempos and intensities.

				</p>
				
				<p>
					I consciously absorb everything around me. I document the thoughts that strike me on the Notes app on my phone.
					Never before have I ‘looked’ and ‘listened’ this attentively. It’s like I said before, an opportunity to actively
					appreciate something that I enjoy doing so much. It’s interesting how it feels like getting to know myself better.
					Normally when attending a rave I’m quite aware of the timetable and the DJs who are playing. Due to my last-minute
					decision to attend this rave, I’m not at all this night. I believe this is beneficial for my research. It allows for
					unpredictability and frees me from the need to change locations whenever the DJs switch time slots. I'm open and
					prepared for any experience that comes my way.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Above the first area, a light installation is installed In which three rectangles intersect each other. In these
					rectangles, the light moves through the geometric lanes. Little dots of light follow the lines of the premeditated
					structure like they’re chasing one another. Whenever the other lights in the room dim, leaving only the rectangles
					visible, the tiny dots of light remind me of stars. However, unlike the random placement of stars in the night sky,
					these "stars" follow a path designated by the light designer. This is the visual energy that was stored in
					preparation for the event and now, finally has been released to assist me in my journey to ‘Space’. The speed of the
					running stars adapts to the changing pace of the music. They support me in the act of surrendering myself to the
					trance-inducing rhythms within my sight and the sound.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Often the title of a track or a small line of text with a powerful message is used as additional vocal power to add
					energy to a track. While dancing, I noticed the repetition of these small sections of text function similarly to a
					mantra. Initially, the mantra is repeated until I fully embody its message. I envision the vocals leading a slowly
					advancing, almost demonstrative march of communication. Then, to increase persuasion, new electronic sounds join the
					march one by one in the order of the often 4/4 beat.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Raves alter our perception of time, reshaping it around the duration of the experience. Raves can last for hours or
					even days, temporarily altering our perception of time once we're immersed in 'Space'. The timeframe of the night is
					segmented with various stories being narrated. I wrote in my notes while dancing: “Some choose to write poems others
					write novels”. Some DJs tell their stories by highlighting the chores in different tracks. Others let their story be
					one constructive journey that stretches out over the entire duration of their set wherein the changing of tracks is
					almost unremarkable. Apart from the fact that DJs come prepared in terms of what narrative they plan on telling by
					layering and structuring, there still is a lot of space for interaction with the dancing crowd in terms of the
					overall flow. This interaction leads to an additional story unfolding, transforming the narrative into one that
					includes everyone.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I enter my ’Space’. I adapt the movements I make with my body to whatever tension the track is building up. My feet
					follow the consistent underlying four-beat bass drum of the track. My left and right foot alternate. I start with
					small movements and to change up the dance I sometimes decide to stay one count longer left or right. It’s the
					little changes in the movements that make the dance interesting. My brain constantly plays the game of adapting my
					movements to the changes in the music. Due to my musically trained mind and feel for rhythm I can play a game of
					prediction. By listening and learning from the repetitive loops I get a grip on the structure which creates the
					ability to change my movements at the exact moment the music changes. Whenever my prediction is right I get
					overwhelmed with energy that I use in performing whatever next track that is going to challenge me.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Now that my legs visualize the consistent rhythm of the track my arms are here to demonstrate the other additional
					sounds that joined the sonic landscape of the track. Obsessed with visualizing what I hear I use my hands like a
					conductor. Some moments my left and right hand mirror each other. Other times they alternate to take the opportunity
					of visualizing even more elements in the music. I start small and I follow the tension of the track going bigger and
					bigger. Just like a conductor would do. It reminds me of the video I introduced earlier. Here the conductor directed
					the Montpellier Orchestra and Jeff Mills. In the situation of my ‘Space’ the same thing happens to me but then the
					other way around. The music acts as the conductor of which movements I make and with what conviction I carry them
					out. When the energy of the music rises to a point beyond exact expression, all that's left to do is jump and throw
					my arms

				<p>
					To elaborate on the impact of music as a tool to unfold normally hidden facets of people’s persona, I'm including a
					video artwork from 2009 by Rineke Dijkstra called ‘The Krazyhouse’. </h9> <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-12" href="#fn-12">12</a></sup> The artwork contains 5 videos of teenagers,
					named Megan, Simon, Nicky, Philip, and Dee. In the video, the teenagers dance in front of a white backdrop to a
					selected music track. Dijkstra met the performers in ‘The Krazyhouse nightclub’ in Liverpool and asked them to come
					to a studio she constructed in the club during the daytime and dance to their favorite song. The neutral white
					background draws attention to the teenagers and how they present themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dijkstra has described the filmed clips as ‘portraits’, explaining that she wanted to see if she could make a
					portrait of somebody that reveals parts of themselves just by dancing. At times, the teenagers performing seem
					self-conscious, adjusting their clothing and looking shy at the still camera. Further in the video, they confidently
					perform varied dance moves as the result of their very personal musical engagement.
				</p>
				<p>
					By individualizing an experience that is usually lived collectively, the work raises questions about authenticity
					and the boundary between the personal and the general. What I interpret from this artwork is how much people can
					communicate through their body movements. The artwork is a representation of the immediate influence of music on
					dance as a general phenomenon. In some videos, you can see teenagers struggling at first. However, once they
					surrender to the music, they enter their 'Space'. Analyzing the video artwork led me to question whether these five
					individuals are aware of their 'momentum'. If they know how to recharge, and if entering their 'space' is their
					method for doing so.
				</p>
				<p>
					My inner energy is being activated. It’s my fuel to stay on the dance hour after hour. It’s so addictive that I
					continue dancing even when my legs start to cramp and my mouth starts to become dry. The people who know me well,
					know that I dance until the drops of sweat are running all across my body. I pull my fully wet hair up in a bun and
					continue my everlasting self-created choreography. I give everything I have. People smile at me and some even come
					towards me to bring me a high five. Even though I dance purely for myself, I do find joy in receiving recognition
					for the physical effort that dancing requires. I love the moments of interaction with strangers and the exchange of
					energy whenever they join me and take part in the movements I perform. No words are used but there is so much
					communication possible in the non-verbal way that dancing together offers. There have been a few times that fellow
					ravers came up to me to thank me for the energy I carried out. I can tell you without hesitation that those moments
					in ‘Space’ were some of the best moments in my life.

		<p>We raved the night away. The brightness of the new day pulls me back to reality as I make my way home. I like this
			moment. It's a moment for reflection in the early hours on the quiet morning streets.
			My physical body is tired and sore but I can feel it again: the momentum runs through every vein. The remaining
			question is how and when to integrate this newly gained momentum. For now, I can only speculate:</p>
		
		<p>From Blumenberg, I learned how light is the absolute power of being. Superior in the field of sight. And I, as the
			observer of it all am at the same time the composer. I hold the creative power to decide when to stop time and
			immortalize the ever-changing form of light. Letting the graphical element created by light unfold and dictate when
			to freeze time and capture a moment.<br>
			Through his mastery of firm frequencies, Mills draws graphical inspiration with his sound. His ability to orchestrate
			rigid narratives resonates with me. His strict structures teach me how to handle detail and precision. The release
			of stored energetic sounds, composted to forceful rhythmic loops, demand me to follow, strike my core, and at the
			same time calm my mind.<br>
			Dijkstra confirmed all thoughts I had on music being the most powerful tool to let expressiveness exist. It’s a
			gateway to a form of self that normally doesn’t get the chance to exist. Through the act of dance ‘Space’ is made
			accessible. And through ‘Space’ one can build momentum. As we navigate momentum, we can direct its energy toward
			what needs it the most. This is the power of transferring gained energy into the one you can give.</p>
